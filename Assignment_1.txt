                                      APPROACH For Git

1. Create a new folder named hello-git at your favorite location in your system. And navigate to that folder using terminal/cmd/git Bash.
 
2. In your terminal/cmd/git Bash execute following command: 
git init 

3. Now create a new file git-commands.txt inside hello-git folder (repository) and open it in a text editor (Visual Studio Code) is recommended.
 
4. Write git commands and their function in that file and save it.
 
5. Go back to your terminal/cmd/git Bash and execute following commands: 
git add . 
git commit -m "my first git commit." 

6. You completed half of your task. Now go to GitHub and create a new account (If you don’t have one) or login (If you already have account) 

7. Create a new project/repository at GitHub named hello-git and copy the address of newly created project/repository.
 
8. Come back to your terminal/cmd/git Bash again and execute following command: 
git remote add origin "your remote repo address here".

9. And finally upload your project/repository to GitHub by executing following command: 
git push origin master
